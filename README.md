# Asteroid Map
A map app for AsteroidOS. Depends on Qt5 and qml-asteroid. Aims to provide a useful map app optimised for small and round displays, and devices with limited connectivity.
# Features
- Zoom and centre your position with the tap of a button
- Multiple compass modes to help you get your bearings
- Set, label and edit waypoints to mark points of interest

# Planned features and ideas for implementing them
- Manual caching/downloading of map tiles - A useful feature for going offline. The plugin already has automatic caching, but it might be worth exposing this to the user.
- Importing navigation routes - perhaps sending these over from a paired device as GPX, or something else. Probably way off in the future.
- Some sort of navigation system on watch?
