# Asteroid Map
A map app for AsteroidOS. Depends on Qt5 and qml-asteroid. Aims to provide a useful map app optimised for small and round displays, and devices with limited connectivity.

# Usage
- Zoom with buttons instead of pinch-to-zoom.
- Center your view by pressing the 'target' button (after forcing GPS in settings).
- Multiple compass modes to help you get your bearings. Tap to switch between compass indicator and map bearing, reset with a long press.
- Set waypoints to mark areas of interest with a selectable icon. Tap to edit or delete waypoints.

# Planned features and ideas for implementing them
- Manual caching/downloading of map tiles - A useful feature for going offline. The plugin already has automatic caching, but it might be worth exposing this to the user.
- Importing navigation routes - perhaps sending these over from a paired device as GPX, or something else. Probably way off in the future.
- Some sort of navigation system running directly on the watch.
