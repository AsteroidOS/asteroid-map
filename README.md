# Asteroid Map
A map app for AsteroidOS. Depends on Qt5 and qml-asteroid. Aims to provide a useful map app optimised for small and round displays, and devices with limited connectivity.
# Planned features and ideas for implementing them
- Buttons for zoom and centering view on the user.
- Manual caching/downloading of map tiles - A useful feature for going offline. The qt
- Waypoints - save a location, some text, an icon?
- Importing navigation routes - perhaps sending these over from a paired device as GPX, or something else. Probably way off in the future.
- Some sort of navigation system on watch?
